## Disclaimer
For some among you, you may have figured out that this is in fact based on an idea from the TV Show Silicon Valley. Yes it's true - I did lift the idea. However, art is based on borrowing concepts - not stealing. Mostly, this is an exercise in practicing React Native and Firebase while also making me chuckle.
